5 steps to replicate our results:

1) Run "Code_FIcurve_extract_Etype" to obtain standardized electrophysiological data.

2) Run "Code_FIcurve_statisticforCollectingdata"   to collect the parameters of AP waveform.

3) Run "Code_FiringPattern_forCollectingdata"   to collect the parameters of firing pattern.

4) Run "Clustering_tSNE.R" to run PCA based on all the parameters (except for Vm), and get  cluster information  in  a csv file

5) Run "Code_FIcurve_statistic_Etype" to Compared the AP papameters across different clusters, and get box plot.


Dependent m fucntion:
"AP_Statistic_new","eventedgefinder","peakfinder"


For the intrinsic parameters:
1) Run "Code_RinTau_extract_HERE" to obtain standardized electrophysiological data.

2) Run "Code_RinTau_statistic_HERE" to get box plot.
